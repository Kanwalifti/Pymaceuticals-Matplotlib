# Pymaceuticals-Matplotlib

Pymaceuticals Inc. conducted a study involving 249 mice with SCC tumor growth, where they were subjected to different drug regimens. The researchers observed and measured tumor development over a period of 45 days. The main objective of the study was to compare the effectiveness of Pymaceuticals' drug of interest, Capomulin, against other treatment regimens.

Throughout the study, various visualizations were generated to analyze and present the data.

- Summary statistics dataframe

- The bar plot illustrates the total number of timepoints recorded for all mice tested under each drug regimen during the entire study period.

- The pie chart displays the distribution of female and male mice within the study.

- The box plot exhibits the final tumor volume for all four treatment regimens.

- The line plot depicts the relationship between volume and timepoint for the Capomulin treatment of mouse l509.

- The scatter plot illustrates the correlation between tumor volume and mouse weight for the Capomulin treatment regimen.

- The scatter plot showcases the relationship between mouse weight and average tumor volume for the Capomulin treatment. Additionally, a linear regression model is plotted on top of the scatter plot to analyze the correlation between these two variables.


# Observations and Insights:

- Capomulin and Ramicane treatments appear to be more effective in reducing tumor size compared to other treatments.

- A positive correlation of 0.84 exists between mouse weight and average tumor volume. As mouse weight increases, so does the average tumor volume.

- The bar graph indicates that Capomulin and Ramicane had the highest number of mice tested among the treatment regimens.
